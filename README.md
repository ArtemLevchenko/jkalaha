# Users
There are 2 users, who are the players:
* marcoS/marcoS
* brandoN/brandoN

#Game Rules
A) Basic Rules:
* Play always moves around the board in a counter-clockwise circle (to the right)
* The store on your right belongs to you. That is where you keep the seeds you win.
* The six pits near you are your pits.
* Only use one hand to pick up and put down seeds.
* Once you touch the seeds in a pit, you must move those seeds.
* Only put seeds in your own store, not your opponentâ€™s store.

B) Special Rules:
  * When the last seed in your hand lands in your store, take another turn.
  * When the last seed in your hand lands in one of your own pits, if that pit had been empty you
  get to keep all of the seeds in your opponents pit on the opposite side. Put those captured seeds,
  as well as the last seed that you just played on your side, into the store.
